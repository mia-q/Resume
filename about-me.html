<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>I love learning new ways to be creative. I enjoy things 
    like baking, crocheting, playing video games, exercising, 
    reading, and coding of course! I spend much of time at home
    learning new techniques and testing recipes for sweets and pastries.
    I'm always open to trying new things and working to master new skills.
    <!--add more personal info, maybe notes/a paragraph about how you got into coding?-->

    I am also a musician, more specifically an oboist! I studied Music Edcuation at the University 
    of Kentucky and went on to teach music in a public school 
    for 3 years. I developed a love for music and creativity in a new way
    and I still love to make music whenever I get the chance!

<p>Perhaps the most important part of my personal life is loving my cat! Her name is Noodlehead 
    and she is seven years old! She drools and can be a bit anxious at times (as we all can be), but 
    she is perfect in my eyes.
